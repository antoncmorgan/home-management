# Family Member Backend & Frontend Tasks

## Backend Tasks

1. Create `family_members` table in the database.
2. Implement CRUD functions for family members in the DB module.
3. Implement async helpers in `familyMember.ts` for DB-backed CRUD.
4. Implement API endpoints for family members (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
5. Add existence check for update and delete routes.
6. Map DB results from snake_case to camelCase in API responses.
7. Write and update tests for DB-backed helpers and routes.
8. Ensure proper error handling and status codes in all endpoints.

## Frontend Tasks

1. Create a FamilyMember model/interface in the client.
2. Build a right-side user icon nav bar component:
   - Display icons for each family member.
   - Add a plus (+) icon for adding new users.
3. Fetch and manage family members state separately from the authenticated user.
4. Implement modal/form for adding a new family member.
5. Update event display to visually indicate which family member(s) each event belongs to.
6. Integrate API calls for fetching, adding, editing, and deleting family members.
7. Ensure authenticated user info (profile, dropdown) is managed separately from family members.
